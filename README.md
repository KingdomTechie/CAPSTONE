###### Who, What, Why

**Who are my users**: My target audience are software engineers (junior, associate or senior) that are looking for their next career opportunity.  I have found that traditional job search websites have to include a wide demographic of users.  I want a service that is solely dedicated to Software Engineers and companies that are looking for them.  

**What do they want**:  My software engineer users want a job searching service where they can have a much more focused experience.  With this service they will be able to showcase their skills, projects, and desires.  On the other hand, companies that are using the service will be able to quickly and efficiently search for talent to exact specifications.

**Why**: I am a software engineer and I have found that the quality of mainstream job searching websites did not cater enough to my skill set and search queries.  For example, Iâ€™d like to check in what skills I have, how long I have had them, and then be able to search for companies that match exactly what I have to offer.  I want to find companies that are looking for exactly what I have offer.The Software Engineering workforce stood at over 680,000 workers in the field in the United States.
